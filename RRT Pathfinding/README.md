## Rapidly Expanding Random Tree (RRT) Pathfinding

This directory contains the code and files for implementing Rapidly Expanding Random Tree (RRT) pathfinding algorithm in a rectangular workspace with obstacles.

In this project, we aim to find a feasible path from a given start point to a goal point using the RRT algorithm. The workspace is defined as a rectangular region, and it includes three or more obstacles of different shapes and sizes. 

The program generates a set of random points starting from the initial point and expands a tree structure by connecting these points in a branching manner. The algorithm explores the workspace by iteratively generating feasible points in random directions with a fixed step length.

By running the code in this directory, you will be able to visualize the rectangular workspace with obstacles, mark the start and goal points, and observe the roadmap generated by the RRT algorithm. The final path from the initial point to the goal point will be determined based on the discovered tree structure.

Feel free to explore the code and associated files to understand the RRT pathfinding process and experiment with different workspace configurations.

### Note

- The code is written in Python.
- Comment and Uncomment the different obstacles in the sections `obstacles where path is found, Set #:` or `obstacles where path not found:` to get the output for different obstacleÂ spaces.
