## Integrated-Motion-Planning-Project
Welcome to the Motion Planning Integration repository! This project combines C-Space analysis, Rapidly Expanding Random Tree (RRT), and Potential Field algorithms for efficient robot motion planning in various workspaces.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive solution for robot motion planning by integrating different algorithms. It encompasses three key components: C-Space analysis, RRT, and Potential Field pathfinding.

### Features
- C-Space analysis: Generates C-Space for a 2-DOF planar robot arm with obstacles of different shapes and sizes. Provides visualizations of both Cartesian and C-space representations.
- RRT algorithm: Finds a feasible path from the start to goal points in a rectangular workspace with obstacles. Generates a roadmap and presents the final path.
- Potential Field method: Navigates through a 2D workspace with obstacles using attractive and repulsive fields. Optimizes field constants to discover efficient paths from the start to goal points.

### Usage
To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/Integrated-Motion-Planning-Project.git
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the main program.
4. Explore the generated results and visualizations.

### Examples and Results
This section demonstrates the output and results obtained from running the project. It includes screenshots, figures, or GIFs showcasing the following:

- C-Space generation with obstacle representation.
- RRT-generated roadmap and the resulting path from start to goal points.
- Potential Field paths with varying attractive and repulsive field constants.
