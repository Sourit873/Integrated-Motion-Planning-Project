## C-Space Generation for 2 DOF Planar Robot Arm

This directory contains the code and files for generating the C-Space for a 2 Degree of Freedom (2 DOF) planar robot arm. 

The purpose of this assignment is to develop a program that generates the C-Space representation for the robot arm, considering obstacles of various shapes, sizes, and colors within the workspace. 

The program utilizes suitable lengths for the robot arm's links and provides visualizations of both the Cartesian space (x, y) and the C-Space (θ1 vs. θ2). The links of the robot arm can be represented as straight lines or rectangles, based on the chosen implementation.

By running the code in this directory, you will be able to visualize the robot arm, the obstacles in the workspace, and observe the resulting C-Space plot. This visualization aids in understanding the configurations of the robot arm that are feasible and the potential collisions with the obstacles.

Feel free to explore the code and associated files to gain insights into the C-Space generation process for the 2 DOF planar robot arm.

### Note

The code is written in Python but in Jupyter notebook.
